## Overview

* [Creating a new project](#part-2-creating-a-new-project)

## Part 1: Setting Up

When you first open Factorio Mod Maker, you will be greeted with the following screen:

Before you can start creating a new project, you need to set up the location of the Factorio executable and data.
To do this, click on the `Setup Factorio Location` button at the bottom of the screen.
> You can also press `Alt` and the underlined letter of the button to click it.

This will open the following dialog:

To set up the location of the Factorio data, either type in the path to the Factorio installation directory or click the
`Browse` button to select it manually. Unless you installed Factorio in a different location, the open dialog should
open at Factorio's installation directory.
Do the same with the Factorio executable.

Once both paths are set up and correct, click the `OK` button to save the settings.

## Part 2: Creating a New Project

To create a new project, click on the `Create New Mod` button at the bottom of the screen. You will see the following
dialog:
![new_project.png](new_project.png)
The mod title is what your mod will be called in Factorio. The mod name is the internal name of the mod and is used as
the folder name.
You must fill in all fields with a `*` preceding them.
> You can also press `Alt` and the underlined letter of the label to go to the textbox next to it.
